# Rotate

Automator scripts to rotate selected images in Finder (or any applications) to right or left

Two scripts:
  - Rotate_Left : 90° left rotation on selected files
  - Rotate_Right : 90° rigth rotation on selected files

Can be edited directly in Automator (Yosemite 10.10.3).

Installation:
  Scripts can be automatically installed by double-clic and them, select "Install".
  Otherwise you can manually install them in the Services location : ~/Library/Services
  
Usage:
  1 - Right clic on an image or images in the Finder
  2 - Services
  3 - Select the Rotate_Left or Rotate_Right, that's it!
